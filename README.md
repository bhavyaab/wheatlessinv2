### Architecture
This API is structured on a Middleware(Authentication and Error catching), Model(Schema), Router pattern. The base technologies are node.js server, node.http module, express middleware, AWS and a mongo database. This architecture is currently deployed in a two tier environment(staging, production), leveraging the heroku platform.

  **Middleware**:
 - The express router middleware provides the base routing capability.
 - A custom handle-errors module implements and extends the http-errors npm middleware package.
 - An auth middleware module leverages two npm modules (bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken) and the node.crypto module to provide user sign-up and    user sign-in functionality as well as business for authentication/authorization and post the menu.
 - The mongoose npm module is used for interaction with the mongo database.
 - Aws is used to store image data and mongoose stores only referance (image URI), in order to make it more ifficient.

**Model**:
 - Each resources (user, biz, pic, menu) are mongoose Schema and have dedicated router files located in the route folder. In addition to providing an interface to the pubic user, these files provides modular structure.
 - For details about the input and output of routes, see the Routes section below.

**Router**:
 - Individual resources (user, biz, menu, pics) have dedicated router files. These files are the interface between the server, middleware, and model files and mongo and Aws database. When a request is made, router calls the necessary functions to interact with the model. They then return a response to the route once a request has been processed in the model, also parse the json content in the incoming request (where applicable) and create and populate a req.body property using the npm package parse-body.
